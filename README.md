# death-penalty-analysis
Analyzing death penalty data particularly in terms of fairness toward minorities

# Setup
Main thing you'll need is selenium to help with scraping the data from each of the sources.

# Running
Run `crawler.py` to create JSON files of each of the data sources.

After that finishes, you can run `simulate.py` to run the simulations.
The simulations essentially operate as if deciding who should be on death row was like picking marbles out of a bag. This being the theoretical ideal in terms of ethnic/racial distribution of those on death row.
